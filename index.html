                                        webs as well as a learning platform to experience what is
                                        in behind of current Internet Technologies for the
                                        World Wide Web. J1 provides creative people with both:
                                        a rich toolset to build websites and the knowledge needed
                                        to learn what's all about.

<pre>
  This page is created by the layout: {{ page.layout }}.

  If this text is displayed (instead of the home page expected),
  something went  wrong with the layout definitions. Check  the
  output of the Jekyll engine building this site.

  Check the  contents   of folder _layouts. Verify  if the base
  layout  "{{ page.layout }}" exists  and the  referring  chain
  (inheritance) is correct.

  If you see this page within the J1 Template DEVELOPMENT system,
  re-run a site built running:

    yarn rebuild site

  If you're on a RUNTIME system run a built like so:

    yarn rebuild

  and open the website again by:

    yarn site
