<pre>

  This page is created by the layout: {{ page.layout }}.

  If this text is displaywd (instead of the home page expected),
  something went  wrong with the layout definitions. Check  the
  output of the Jekyll engine building this site.

  Check the  contents   of folder _layouts. Verify  if the base
  layout  "{{ page.layout }}" exists  and the  referring  chain
  (inheritance) is correct.

  If you see this page within the J1 Template DEVELOPMENT system,
  re-run a site built running:

    yarn rebuilt site

  If you're on a RUNTIME system run a built like so:

    yarn rebuilt

  and open the website again by:

    yarn site
