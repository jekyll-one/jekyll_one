As he climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid's motorbike and takes to the skies,
leaving Privet Drive for the last time, Harry Potter knows that Lord Voldemort
and the Death Eaters are not far behind. The protective charm that has kept
Harry safe until now is now broken, but he cannot keep hiding.

The Dark Lord is breathing fear into everything Harry loves, and to stop him
Harry will have to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. The final battle
must begin - Harry must stand and face his enemy. These new editions of the
classic and internationally bestselling, multi-award-winning series feature
instantly pick-up-able new jackets by Jonny Duddle, with huge child appeal,
to bring Harry Potter to the next generation of readers.
