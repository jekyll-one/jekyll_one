Not Dead Yet is Phil Collins candid, witty, unvarnished story of the songs
and shows, the hits and pans, his marriages and divorces, the ascents to the
top of the charts and into the tabloid headlines.

As one of only three musicians to sell over 100 million records both in a
group and as a solo artist, Collins breathes rare air, but he has never lost
his talent for crafting songs that touch listeners around the globe.

This is the story of his epic career, from child actor to one of the most
successful songwriters of the pop music era.

A drummer since almost before he could walk, Collins received on-the-job
training in the seedy, thrilling bars and clubs of 1960s swinging London
before finally landing the drum seat in Genesis. Later he would step into the
spotlight on vocals after the departure of Peter Gabriel, and compose the songs
that would rocket him to international solo fame with the release of Face Value
and *In the Air Tonight*.

Whether he's recalling jamming with Eric Clapton and Robert Plant, pulling
together a big band fronted by Tony Bennett, playing twice at Live Aid, or
writing the Oscar-winning music for Disney's smash-hit animated film Tarzan,
Collins keeps it intimate and his storytelling gift never wavers.
