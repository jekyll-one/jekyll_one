The template system was originally developed to create a simple, but fully
configurable website creation toolset for document servers. Document servers
provide websites, or other content formats like PDF, for projects, for software
documentation or similar approaches.

Many large today's companies like {url-docker--docs}[Docker, {browser-window--new}]
are using template based systems to create their documentation sites. Or like
{url-oreilly-atlas--home}[O'Reilly Atlas, {browser-window--new}],
to provide a fully featured writers platform for writing books or large
documentation.

All these platform are technically different but they share common ideas:

* the layout of all content (pages) is based on a common skeleton, but
  separated from the content
* content is written using a neutral meta-language
* the final output is not predefined
* the output is automatically generated by engines (robots)

To make this ideas real, a lot of things are need; you can imagine. The
approaches of Docker or O'Reilly points to a possible solution: a template
system based on _Bootstrap_ for the CCS framework, _Jekyll_ and _Liquid_ for
the core engines, and _Asciidoc_ (Asciidoctor) for a neutral meta-language
writing content.

The next thought comes on my mind. Why developing a toolset for only
document servers? Documentation webs of today are complex websites. Some
features used for general web design may not needed for documentation systems,
but a lot of components are needed that are generally needed:

* a powerful CSS and Javascript framework
* a modular approach for dynamic content and apps
* a configuration system to separate content from layout and to automate
  creation processes following the development pattern *MVC*
  (https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/[Model–View–Controller, {browser-window--new}])

A plan was made in 2016, based on Jekyll V3 and Bootstrap V3, to create a
template-based robot-system that can be used for all types of websites, for
all common formats to create digital content.

I was too optimistic how long it would take to build such a system:

* easy to use by developers and non-technical people
* modular, powerful and stable
* supporting modern content design
* usable on common computer hardware, available to the public
* less in components, using well-known software
* fully usable on small PC's locally as well as on powerful remote systems
  on the Internet

It took me nearly 4 years. Now, early 2021, I can present the first version of
J1 Template for the public. Hopefully most of the objectives are achieved.

Have fun!
