<p>It is not a secret, that many options are available today to create  and present a web. Content Management Systems like Wordpress or Online Services like Wix can be used to manage and present a website. CMS are fairly complex because of their nature. CMS are creating dynamic  pages stored in database systems. And they are using complex programming  interfaces to generate each and every page.  On the other hand, a Online Service simplifies the process of creating a  website a lot but you&#8217;re quite limited in what a Service Provider is giving  you at your hands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To learn what is behind the scenes will be a quite challenging job if you go for a CMS. For Content Management Systems, expect a really steep learning curve to get an insight view. If you have plans using an Online Service, forget about learning.  A provider won&#8217;t get you any insight view what&#8217;s happening in behind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                         J1 is created to flatten the learning curve for learning how modern websites are being created. Using Jekyll One, people can start on a beginner level but  simultaneously achive good results. That&#8217;s important for all users but especially  for learners.
