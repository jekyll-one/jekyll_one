== Heaven and Hell of writing

//icon:tags[role="md-pink"] From: {uri-blog-stoyan-stefanov}[Stoyan Stefanov]

Many people find the idea of writing a book or an article difficult. I think
this is mainly due to a poor *definition* of what *writing* is.

In movies, there is this romantic idea of the process, the *act of writing*.
The author struggles, drama ensues. Then all of a sudden inspiration strikes.
The author sits down all the night just listening to what inspiration says.
In the morning, among a pile of cigarette butts and empty wine bottles,
there is a brand new spanking *chef-d'Å“uvre* of a manuscript.

Everyone who reads it says: it's the best thing ever! Or, if the author
is ahead of his time (as may happen in drama) average Joe is saying:
what a shit. But more in a theatrically way.

The author is done. Let's celebrate, while waiting for the next visit by her
majesty, the Muse.

That's definitely *not how it works* with sophisticated text, articles or even
books. I don't have first-hand experience with fiction, but from what I've read
from fiction writers, that's not how it works with fiction either. Writing is a
scilled craft. A technique, or a bunch of them.

Let's dive into scilled crafted writing.

=== The White page

When people buy into the romantic idea of the Muse and one-off writing
sessions, and they try to write, no wonder they fail. Imagine out hero
saying: *"Heck! I'm going to write a computer book! I know a lot about Web
Design. What a hell should be easier to do as I'm a specialist for the Web!*

He creates a new folder, a new file called *book.doc* and proceeds typing
the title: *Responsive Design with HTML5 and CSS3*. He likes it. Next, a
subtitle: *Unleash the power of mobile, social, local, yadda and dadda*.

OK, so how big should the title be? What about the subtitle? 20 minutes
struggling with formatting options in a word processor. The future author
goes: *Meh, I'll worry about formatting later*.

New page. Next White page ... *Big white page*.

The new author let the mind wander for once and perhaps even think about
treating himself to a refreshing footbath. The energy will go up from the
foots into the brain to the big white page.

*"History of HTML? Mmmmh. Boring. Not that."*

Still *White Page* ...

*"Should I open with a joke? But what if it falls flat?"*

*White page*.

The next brilliant idea comes on his mind: *"Hey man, I'm connected to the
internet"*. Open the browser. Search for *writer writing block*. The search
engine is telling him: *85.400.000 matches*. Oh Mama, that's a lot.

Trying the first results. The time goes by. The temperature of the refreshing
footbath down.

You see how the prospect of writing is scary for many people.

=== What can be done about it?

There are some magic words in the wild for making something entirely new:
prepare, plan, act and check. Hard to find on a *writer's blog* and 85.400.000
matches are not that helpful.

[horizontal]
[big]*Preparation*::  You already did this part by having this tutorial at your
                      fingertips. Nothing more needed.
[big]*Planning*::     It is always a good idea to divide, what you are intended
                      to do, into steps. First unordered, writing down what do
                      you think what's needed. If the a list of top-level items
                      is in place, order them.
[big]*Acting*::       Go for the first topic of the plan, thhe ordered items
                      you've found.
[big]*Checking*::     Check the results of what you've done so far on a topic.
                      You'll find some things missing in the preparation or the
                      planning. Add the missing parts and start from the
                      beginning.

The 4 steps are done in a cycle. And this cycle is well known: the *Deming Cycle*.

.Deming Cycle or PDCA Cycle

The Deming Cycle, or PDCA Cycle, is a continuous quality improvement model
consisting out of a logical sequence of four repetitive steps for continuous
improvement and learning: Plan, Do, Study (Check) and Act.

As mentioned in the intro part: Writing is *improved speech*. And it is done
in cycles. The Deming Cycle is the base for continuous improvement, the process
needed for writing, for written language, for improved speech. That means vice
versa it is *not needed* to have all things in place from the beginning. It is
an iterative process to complete a step, a task, a level of learning. Furthermore
it *not recommended* to bring all things in place from the beginning, to learn
a bunch of things upfront - it won't work.

Back again to the intro part: Writing is more like sports or making music. It
will always *remain difficult* even after you have done it a lot. Playing a
violine is a *life-long learning process* even you're part of a *world class
orchestra*.

For that reason: Do writing. Shake off the bad feelings if something is
difficult or went wrong. Nothing you do will appear totally foolish. You are
able to do things you had to learn for years. Nobody is perfect. Simple like
this: it could be better. It is the next turn on the Deming Cycle, haha!

Be ensured: all of this is part of the game accepted by all serious authors
on that planet. Be cool, have fun.
