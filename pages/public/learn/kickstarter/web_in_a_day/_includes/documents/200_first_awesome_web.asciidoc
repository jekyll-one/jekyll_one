Welcome to the third section of *Web in a Day*. You’ve survived all the
technical stuff and the preparations needed for setting up a development
environment. +
*Great job*!

You may read a lot of marketing stuff around static websites, the tools, and
benefits. The following characterizes a static web generated by a
*Site Generator*:

* Static sites serve a fixed set of data that renders the same for every
  site visitor. Static sites use *server-side* rendering to serve pre-built
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser.

* In opposition to CMS systems that use a database to load content
  dynamically, a static site will *directly* load the server's HTML files.

* Using a static site generator like _Jekyll_, the engine separates the
  content from the Template. Using a static site generator, you will only
  need to modify it once, and the generator will apply it to all your
  pages.

The Template System J1 uses _Jekyll_ under the hood and provides a lot of
high-level functions to control the web creation process:

* J1 is highly *customizable*. Based on a pure configuration, J1 can create
  a full-featured website. The template system creates static web pages
  using Jekyll as the base HTML code generator.

* For J1, a rich set of modules are already included. The modules support
  usual use cases of a website like a flexible navigation system, a local
  search, lightboxes to present pictures and videos, helpers for smooth
  scrolling, or to automatically create TOCs (table of contents) for a page.

Are all the statements true? Are static websites easy to create, fast and
secure? Is it easy to manage such a web? +
*Many open question for now*!

Let's start by creating a static web and *verify* if the promises could be
satisfied and what that means for your *First awesome Web*.

== A first awesome Web

To remind you of _Ruby_ GEMs, the module concept of _Ruby_ is
different in comparison to other programming languages. For _Ruby_, a
GEM *can* contain command-line interfaces (CLI, commands) to access
higher-level functionality.

The J1 Template GEM contains such a CLI: `j1`. The command is used to create
(generate) a web *project*. Generate such a project is the very first step
to manage a *new* website for the J1 Template System.

=== Creating a J1 project

First, a project *folder* is needed. J1 can generate a project elsewhere, but
I recommend creating a central *Web* folder to place (all) websites.

Open a command shell (cmd.exe) and run:

.Base folder for all webs
[source, msshell]
----
md C:\J1Webs && cd C:\J1Webs
----
Next, a project is to be created for the new website using the CLI *j1*. It
is expected that your current folder (in that shell) is *C:\J1Webs*.

.Generate a starter web
[source, msshell]
----
j1 generate starter
----

This will take a while for the *first* J1 project because additional _Ruby_
GEMs are to be downloaded. Because some of the GEMs are *platform-specific*,
the DevKit (installed at the time the _Ruby_ language was installed) is
called to *compile* specific components for the _Windows_ platform.

----
<1> For J1 projects, some _Ruby_ modules are patched to make them usable
    on _Windows_
<2> Ruby GEM folder for *userized* modules
<3> J1 Project for the generated website

NOTE: Some Ruby GEMs, *eventmachine*, and *execJS*, for example, have to be
patched on _Windows_ respective for the newer versions of _Ruby_. As mentioned
earlier, a massive number of libraries are provided by private persons but not
*continuously* updated to make them usable for the recent versions of Ruby's
development system. The affected GEMs are currently *not* updated for the newer
versions of _Ruby_ of v27 or v26. For J1, the needed (patched) components were
added to the J1 Template system and applied when a project is generated.

CAUTION: Patched versions of the _Ruby_ GEMs *eventmachine* and *execJS*
are available only using *J1*. The original versions cannot be used and
will make the generator engine _Jekyll_ fail.

If the generation process has finished, this results in a project *scaffold*.
To make this scaffold a usable *J1* project, this data structure is to be
*initialized* first.


=== Setting up the project

The next step, done only once, is to *initialize* the project to download and
install all resources for your new website, followed by a *first* creation
process for the new website. Initializing a project is managed by the task
`setup` run by the _NodeJS_ package manager.

A bunch of sub-tasks gets fired. All of them are controlled package manager
*yarn* for you. The J1 project is generated in folder *C:\J1Webs\starter*.
Change to that folder and set up the project using the command `yarn`.

.Setting up the J1 project
[source, msshell]
----
cd C:\J1Webs\starter && yarn setup
----

Because a lot of **sub**-tasks getting started for a (first) `setup`, see
below the output as a summary:

----
Setup project for first use ..
Bootstrap base modules ..

                    done in 37.609 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
.. build finished.
To open the site, run: yarn site
Done in 94.94s.
----

The task `setup` takes a while. Typically some minutes for the *first*
run (depending on the performances of your Internet connection and your
Desktop PC). A bunch of NPM modules and Ruby Gems gets downloaded, installed,
and linked for the project. See the setup task as an extended *install* and
*build* process to make your new website ready to use.

=== Run a site

As discussed, all project-related *tasks* are managed by the package manager
for NodeJS -- in this case, yarn. The task to run a website is `site` and can
be issued like so:

.Run a J1 website
[source, msshell]
----
yarn site
----

The following messages appear in your command shell:

----
yarn run v1.22.10
$ run-p -s site:*
Startup the site ..
UTILSRV disabled. Not started.

----
<1> The configuration file for the builder engine _Jekyll_
<2> The project folder
<3> The *WebRoot* folder for your website creaated
<4> The *URL* to access the web
<5> A *LiveReloader* is started and listens on port *40001*
<6> A webbrowser has been started automatically and the *LiveReloader*
    is connected

Your *default* web browser is automatically started, and the website gets
loaded. +
That should look like this way:

.The J1 build-in Starter Web
lightbox::kickstart-wiad--starter-web[ 800, {data-kickstart-wiad--starter-web} ]
// <1> Navigation bar
//<2> QuickLinks bar

Now, after so much theory and technical stuff, you should *explore* your
new website. The base navigation provided is the *Navigation* bar conum:1[].
and the *QuickLink* bar conum:2[].

Give your new starter web a try. Take some time to inspect your site, surf on
some pages, and come back to the next section: *Check your project in a code
editor*.

*Have a pleasant walk-around*!

NOTE: Some pages of the *Starter Web* are very the same as used for the J1's
homepage. All pages of the *roundtrip* are fully included with the example website
to help write more complex pages.


=== Check your project in a code editor

To *manage* a J1 project, the most critical tool to do this is the *editor*
you've installed. You can use a good code editor for a so-called
*Integrated Development Environment* (IDE). All functions, all features, are
included or can be easily added by *extensions*.

J1 Template comes with *no* Graphical User Interface (GUI) included. The
functionality of a *GUI* is substituted by the power of the IDE, your code
editor. For users not experienced in using code editors have to exercise a
bit how to use an editor. You’ll learn how helpful an IDE is and (hopefully)
understand why programmers prefer an IDE over any GUI-driven tool to work on
code-based projects.

NOTE: For examples related to the usage of a code editor, _Atom_ is used.
_VS Code_ supports you in the *same* way.

The base creating websites using J1 are:

* *code*, source data of your content
* *data*, control information for the builder engine _Jekyll_ how
  to transform source data into HTML pages

Both are written as simple *text* files, the reason why a code editor is a
good choice. Two *types* of files are the most important in the beginning
to know:

* for the *code*, the source data of your content, the markup language
  *Asciidoc* is used
* for the *data*, control information for the builder engine, the markup
  language *YAML* is used

In computer *text* processing, a markup language is a system for *annotating*
a (text-)document by *control* information: the markups.

*Asciidoc* is used to *annotate* the sources of your web content. The Asciido
markups indicate, for example, what text in a page should be displayed in
*boldface*, what text should be *headlines*, where to place *images*, or what
should be transformed in *tables* or *lists*.

*YAML* is used to indicate text as *data structures* like simple *variables*
or more complex structures like *arrays*. The data is used by the builder
engine _Jekyll_ and by the build-in modules of the J1 Template to control
their behavior.

NOTE: J1 does *not* use a Database System in the sense of an *RDBMS*, a
Relational Database Management System as CMS does. For making a template
system like J1 flexible and configurable, a *database* is *needed*. The
*database* for J1 consists of (text-)files of type *YAML*.

You are reading this for the first time. And, understandably, the codebase is
difficult to understand. To become familiar with the codebase and folder
structure for a J1 project, have a look at your project by your favorite editor.
Open the project folder for your Starter Web, for example, *C:\J1Webs\starter*.

.Starter Web loaded by Atom Editor
lightbox::kickstart-wiad--atom-starter-web[ 800, {data-kickstart-wiad--atom-starter-web} ]

A J1 project consists of several files and folders. Find the structure
as below:

  │     └─ _data  <1>
  │     └─ _includes <2>
  │     └─ _plugins <3>

<6>   Folder that contains all Articles
<7>   Central site configuration (Jekyll)

<9>   Homepage for the Web
<10>  J1 Project file (NPM)

NOTE: After setting up a project,some more files are created by the *setup*
process in the *project* folder. For now, *ignore* these files.

=== The Jekyll configuration file

The Jekyll configuration file `_config.yml` sits in the *root* of your project
directory and, as the name suggests, controls the configuration settings how
*Jekyll* and *J1* are processing your site (from a global perspective).

Open this file in your editor. The configuration file is of type *text*, but
structured! The extention of *.yml* indicates this file of type *YAML*
containing *markups* to specify *data*. The data in that file in in ordered in
sections for easier reading. Comments, starting with a hash (*#*) are not
treated as data. Comments are ignored if such a file is being read and
processed for data extraction.

From the config file you see, your website is processed in `production` mode.
The *variable* `environment` is assigned the *value* `production`. Pretty easy
to read, isn't it? Now the first *magic* of using a code editor. In your
editor, press the keys kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+F] to open a *project-wide* search

== Exercises

Learning is only possible by practicing. It is a matter of fact, that the
learning success requires exercising. To support you, find in this section
some examples to execute J1 for real-world usage.

=== Environment modes

Environment modes are used to specify the built *environment* of a website,
controls the HTML processing. J1 uses these modes to control the *output*
of *HTML pages*.

.Environment modes
[cols="^3a,^3a,6a, subs=+macros, options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===============================================================================
|Variable |Value\|s |Description

|`environment`
|`production` \| `development`
|In *production* mode (default), the generated HTML pages are *compressed*
for faster loading. All HTML elements not needed are stripped (comments), all
whitespaces and not needed control characters are deleted.

In *development* mode, the generated HTML pages are *beatified* for better
(human) reading. *No* elements are deleted and available for code inspection.

|===============================================================================

The *destination* folder for the generated web pages were set by:
[source, yaml, role="noclip"]]
----
destination:                            _site
----

You'll find a folder *_site* in your project root. Open that folder in your
editor and open the file *index.html*, the *home page* for your web. The (HTML)
page generated is a *single* line. All elements *not* needed for the browser
are deleted.

.Home page in production mode (index.html)
lightbox::kickstart-wiad--atom-home-page-1[ 800, {data-kickstart-wiad--atom-home-page-1} ]

Generating HTML output for *production* this is called *compression*,
deleting all (HTML) elements not needed. The file size gets reduced to a
minimum for faster loading by the webserver. Compressed output is excellent
for websites that should be deployed (make them available) to a *public place*,
to a server providing your page on the *Internet*.

For *development*, compressed HTML pages are not useful. You'll see why in
a minute. Reconfigure the *value* for environment. Load the config file
*_config.yml* in your editor, change the value from `production` to
`development` and safe that file.

[source, yaml, role="noclip"]]
----
environment:                            development
----

NOTE: If global configuration settions (setting in *_config.yml*) are changed,
the web needs to be *rebuild*. This is a drawback for static websites.

Because a *global* configuration setting has changed, the web needs to be
*re-created*. This process is called *rebuilding* a site. Stop the running
web in the *command shell* by typing: kbd:[CTRL+C].

A J1 project runs _Jekyll_ in *incremental* mode with *auto-regeneration*
enabled. All changes made to your posts and pages at *runtime* are
automatically detected, and the affected files are rebuilt and (live) reloaded.
As mentioned, this doesn't work for *global configuration* changes.

A web can completely be *re-created* by running the task `rebuild`:

[source, sh]
----
yarn rebuild
----

----
Rebuild site incremental ..
Clean up site files ..

                    done in 14.54 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
.. rebuild finished.
To open the site, run: yarn site.
Done in 24.43s.
----

If the site has been rebuild, re-run the task `site` to make the web
available, again

[source, sh]
----
yarn site
----

The HTML output has been changed for *development*. In your code editor, the
home page looks very different:

[source, html, role="noclip"]
----

The HTML output is *no* longer a vast single line. Many (HTML-)comments are
available that explain what had happened while processing this page. The
comments provide helpful information, what *component* of the Template system
was involved in what *processing step* to *create* a page.

NOTE: For this tutorial, or for creating webs in general, it's not needed
to know how J1 processes HTML pages. But for people interested in more
technical details, the comments explain what had happened in terms of the
processing chain. The comments help understand the underlying builder engine
and what modules were involved in creating the HTML page.

=== The WebRoot folder

Once Jekyll has built a website site, the resulting web, the entire static
site, including all *assets*, gets written to the *destination* folder. In
section <<The Jekyll configuration file>>, you'll find the configuration
parameter `destination` that controls *what* folder is used.

[source, yaml, role="noclip"]

destination:                            _site

<3>   Folder that contains all *Blog Posts*

<5>   Default favicon for the site
<6>   The Home Page
<7>   Info file for search engines (crawlers)
<8>   Structure data of the site content used by search engines (crawlers)

Open the *WebRoot* folder in your code editor. The *home page* of your websites
is sitting in the WebRoot folder, all other generated HTML content gets written
to:

* *pages*, the folder that contains all *Articles*
* *posts*, the folder that contains all *Blog Posts*

Compare the folder structures for *posts* and *pages* by their corresponding
*source* folders *collections* and *pages* in the *project* root folder. If
the folders *pages* are compared for *source* and *destination*, you'll find
some *differences*.

Much more *different* is the picture if *collections* and *posts* are
compared. First, why is the *source* folder for posts *collections*?
The reason is that _Jekyll_ supports *three* content types:

* posts
* collections
* pages

The builder engine _Jekyll_ differentiate content into *two* classes:

* ordered content
* unordered content

I hear your voices: what the hell is that! If not, that was what I did first.

What criteria is _Jekyll_ using to *order* content? No big deal: it's the
time. For _Jekyll_ websites, blog posts have a timestamp to make them
*time-lined*. That is the same for all Blogging systems in general. The order
over *time* makes it possible to differentiate *older* posts from the *newer*
ones. The following criteria for *ordering* blogs post is the *category* they
belong to.

In short, blog articles are ordered by:

* time *first*
* followed by their *category*

If you look at the *Blog* Navigator J1 provides, check the NavBar of your
starter web for *Blog*, it becomes clearer why ordering content makes sense.

.J1 Blog Navigator
lightbox::kickstart-wiad--blog-navigator-1[ 800, {data-kickstart-wiad--blog-navigator-1} ]

NOTE: The content-type *collections* are *not* discussed in that course, not
to exceed the time frame of a day.

Contrasting the *pages*, the unordered content. As the term implies, pages
are *not* ordered. For J1, the content type is *sorted* using the build-in
*navigation* module.

Each content type follows a specific scheme, the generate so-called
*perma-links*, the base to create URL's to access your web pages by a web
browser. The *perma-links* gets discuseed in more detail in the following
chapters focussing on *writing* content.

Each content type follows a specific scheme, generating so-called

Finally, compare the *assets* folder for source and destination. You’ll
find many folders were created on the output side but do not exist in your
project folder.

*Is it magic*?

No, no magic. J1 is a **GEM**-based template, and some resources are part of
the GEM, the _Ruby_ library. The folders *data* and *themes* are not part
of a J1 project but available by the GEM and used to generate the web from the
library location. The folders contain control information for the build-in
modules and all the *CSS*, *Javascript*, and *Font* resources required for
your new awesome web.

The next *again*! You finished your *step-in* into the world of *J1* and
_Jekyll_. Time to have a break. You have deserved a break!

If you return, some stuff for wrapping up is provided to consolidate what is
learned so far.
